 *          href: 'https://www.example.com/product/123', // Make sure there aren't any personal info in the href
 *          route: '/product/:id',
 *          audience: 'Freelancer', // Who is triggering this event e.g. a role or "new user"

 * When sending a page view event to Mixpanel we will pass this event to our own backend that is used as a proxy for Mixpanel.
 * It differs from the `MixpanelEvent` in that it has a fixed `name` and information about the page should be provided
 *
 * @example
 * const event: MixpanelPageViewEvent = {
 *    data: {
 *      title: 'Product Page', // What page is the event triggered on
 *      pathname: '/product/123', // Make sure there aren't any personal info in the path

 *      route: '/product/:id',
 *      audience: 'Freelancer', // The audience that is viewing the page
 *   },
 *   context: { // This is optional and will be mostly provided by the MixpanelProvider
 *      pwa: true, // Is the event triggered in a PWA
 *      utm_source: 'Facebook', // track the source where traffic is coming from, including a website or advertiser
 *      utm_medium: 'advertising', // track the advertising medium, including email and banner ads
