/**
 * @description
 * When sending a page view event to Mixpanel we will pass this event to our own backend that is used as a proxy for Mixpanel.
 * It differs from the `MixpanelEvent` in that it has a fixed `name` and information about the page should be provided
 *
 *
 * For localSearchParams and globalSearchParams, we can use useLocalSearchParams and useGlobalSearchParams from expo-router
 * See: https://docs.expo.dev/router/reference/search-parameters/
 *
 * @example
 * const event: MobileMixpanelPageViewEvent = {
 *   context: {
 *     utm_source: 'Facebook', // track the source where traffic is coming from, including a website or advertiser
 *     utm_medium: 'advertising', // track the advertising medium, including email and banner ads
 *     utm_campaign: 'Black friday', // track the campaign name associated with the traffic
 *     utm_content: 'cta button', //track the specific link within in an ad that a user clicked
 *     utm_term: 'tv sale', // track keywords associated with campaigns
 *   },
 *   data: {
 *     pathname: '/product/detail', // The path of the page where the event is triggered
 *     localSearchParams: { product_id: '123' }, // The local search params of the page where the event is triggered
 *     globalSearchParams: { global_id: '12' }, // The global search params of the page where the event is triggered
